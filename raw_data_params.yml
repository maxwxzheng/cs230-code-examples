# Each video in data/raw_data includes multiple squats.
# This file maps each video name to an array of clip parameters.
# Each entry in the array represents the parameters of a clip (a full squat).
# Format of 'start' and 'end' is 'HH:MM:SS:ss'.
# 'ss' represents fractional second. Range is [0, 29]. This is mainly because
# the software 'Wondershare Filmora9' we used to view the videos displays time
# this way.
# 'HH' and 'MM' are optional.
